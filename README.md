Kakeibo: The Japanese Art Of Saving Money


Money Pool: A money pool is a technique that people worldwide living in poverty (or close to it) have used for centuries to save for large expenses. Here's the way it works: Each member of the pool contributes the same amount of cash each month. Then, they each take turns receiving the lump sum.

## Ideas

- Track your spendings
  - Tag your spendings by a company name or friend name to be able to filter later
- Track where you could save based on monthly expenditure

### Finance

  In layman terms, there could be only 4 kind of transactions in finance
  
  - Money comes-in
  - Money goes out
  - Money supposed to come-in
  - Money supposed to go out
