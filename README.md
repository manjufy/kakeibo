Money Pool: A money pool is a technique that people worldwide living in poverty (or close to it) have used for centuries to save for large expenses. Here's the way it works: Each member of the pool contributes the same amount of cash each month. Then, they each take turns receiving the lump sum.

## Ideas

- Track your spendings
